# Student-Management-System-Using-Java-Full-Stack
Thanks to Kodnest's Java Internship programme. I gained konwledge in Java programming, which explored the language's fundamental ideas and real-world full stack development applications. The application helps in creating, updation, reading and deletion of students data (CRUD operations). I thank my trainers in guiding me built such a wonderful, interactive and responsive project.

## What I learnt?
1. Java Programming Basics
2. Using Java Standard Library
3. Knowledge about Database Connectivity
4. Web Development with Java using Spring
5. Frontend development along with tools like Hibernate
